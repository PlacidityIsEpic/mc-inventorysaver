## Instructions
Reminders: STAND on the barrel. If you don't the machine might malfunction. There are also instruction signs if you don't want to read this.

The Occupied by sign is for if you're using multiplayer. Other than that it's kinda decorational.
Stand on the barrel. Put your items in it, and when you're ready presss the "Get Items Back" button.
